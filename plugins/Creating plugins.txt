1) Create a folder for your plugin in "plugins" directory.
2) Create a new project in visual studio as "Class Library" in that folder.
3) Go to project properties, set:
	a) Application->Target framework: ".NET Framework 4.6.1"
	b) Build->Output Path: "..\..\" (without brackets) (your dll file will be copied to your plugin directory)
4) Add reference to PoeHUD.exe (it can be with other name) and set "Copy local: false" in properties.
5) Optional: (but required for SharpDX drawing) add libraries in "PoEHUD64\lib" directory (also set "Copy local: false" in properties).
5) Create a class, add "using PoeHUD.Plugins;" at the top, and inherit it from "BasePlugin" 
or from "BaseSettingsPlugin<MySettings>" if your plugin need some settings to save, where "MySettings" is your class for options inherited from "SettingsBase".
6) Do your stuff by overriding functions from base class.
7) Detailed information about errors that was occurred in plugin you can found in ErrorsLog.txt in your plugin folder.

Everything other is the same as PoeHud programming.

To make a settings class for "BaseSettingsPlugin" just make a class inherited from "SettingsBase". To add some options to PoeHUD menu use "Menu" attribute. For example:
[Menu("Auto Update")]
public ToggleNode AutoUpdate { get; set; }

Check existing sources of other plugins for more information.

Note: Use carefully the class constructor for your code, errors from it can't be handled & logged.
Also don't forget to turn on your plugin in PoeHUD menu, otherwice it will not be rendered.
